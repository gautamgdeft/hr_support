                              </li>
                              <li>There are Managers who have started their careers as plain editors, designers, engineers, but have proven skill development year on year and accumulated leadership and communication skills over the years and hence was internally promoted
                              </li>
                              <li>Then there are managers who have improved personal skill over time, equipped with specialised training who have moved to become Business Heads, Directors and lead departments.
                              </li>
                              <li>So while there is a growth path, we encourage every team member to shine light on that path with skill development and personal learning. 
                              </li>
                              <li>At Flatworld we understand if we stop learning, we stop growing, if we stop growing, we die. We take 3600  feedback every 6 months and ensure every team member is supported to grow.
                              </li>
                              <li>Every honest employee would love to know how he fares at the workplace; itâ€™s almost a hidden habit to check on scores or feedback.
                              </li>
                              <li>At Flatworld we have devised ways that can ensure correct and genuine feedback is given based on merit, achievement and other factors that celebrate your attitude, acknowledge your skill & knowledge and encourage your quality etc. Do meet your managers for a clear step by step process on how regular performance reviews are done. Great feedback is the cornerstone of happy customers and Growing Companies.</li>
                              <li>Most reviews usually end in a Salary increment, incentive or other perks. However in some cases we also celebrate great reviews with certificates and public acknowledgements.</li> -->
